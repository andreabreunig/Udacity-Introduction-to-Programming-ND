HTML & CSS - Animal Trading Card

This project includes HTML and CSS code in order to create an animal trading card. My animal trading card is about the dog breed Shetland Sheepdog ("Sheltie"). Semantically organized HTML code creates the structure of the animal trading card and the linked CSS code, including CSS classes to avoid repetition, determines the design of the animal trading card.
